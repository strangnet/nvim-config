# nvim-config

This repo is my [neovim](https://neovim.io) configuration. It started out as a pure [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) configuration but is now based on ðŸ’¤ [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Installation

Clone this repo in `~/.config/nvim/` and start `nvim` in the terminal. Enjoy.
